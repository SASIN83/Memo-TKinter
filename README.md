# Memo-TKinter
This is the first GUI I ever tried using any programming language. This GUI is made with Python using TKinter library.

This Memo has a login and registeration system (Not secure enough though). The main purpose of this GUI is to save the text file you created into a folder which is named as your username in the GUI. 

Few Features:
  1. No same username can exist together
  2. All memos/short text files are saved in folder named as username that you logged in with.
  3. Dashboard buttons are expandable.
  4. Deletion and viewing option is also available along with creating a Memo
  5. You can log out from session and login to another session with another account so that another user can use without quitting the program.
  
 What I learned:
  1. Storing, reading, writing data from files and folders in System.
  2. Using data to use as authentication method.
  3. GUI making and some basic concepts of graphics.
